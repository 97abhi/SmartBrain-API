Whener we pass any arguements to a function calll happening as a props, we need to call it
using an arrow function since we need to call that function only at a certain condition
and not always and arrow function helps us do that

ex:
<div className="">
    <input onClick={ ()=>onRoutechange('home') }
    className="b ph3 pv2 input-reset ba b--black bg-transparent grow pointer f6 dib"
    type="submit"
    value="Sign in" />
</div>

here on click event will call on onRoutechangeonly when cliecked
